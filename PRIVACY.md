Privacy Policy for EnNaal

Last updated: February 25, 2026

EnNaal ("the App") is designed to help you plan your goals, track habits, manage meals, and stay in sync with your cycle — all privately on your device.

1. Data Storage
All your data — goals, habits, meal plans, journal entries, cycle information, and preferences — is stored locally on your device only. We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.

2. No Account Required
EnNaal does not require you to create an account, log in, or provide any personal information to use the app.

3. Calendar Access
If you grant calendar permission, EnNaal reads your device calendar events to display them alongside your plans within the app. No calendar data is copied, stored externally, or shared with any third party.

4. AI Meal Suggestions (Optional)
If you choose to use the AI meal suggestion feature, you provide your own OpenAI API key in Settings. When used, your meal preferences and cycle phase are sent to OpenAI to generate suggestions. Your API key is stored only on your device and is never shared with us. Please refer to OpenAI's privacy policy for how they handle data.

5. No Analytics or Tracking
EnNaal does not use any analytics, advertising, or tracking frameworks. We do not collect usage data, device information, or any form of telemetry.

6. No Third-Party Data Sharing
We do not sell, share, or transfer any user data to third parties.

7. Children's Privacy
EnNaal is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.
